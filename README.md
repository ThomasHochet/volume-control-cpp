# V0.1

Trying c++ coding for the first time. Tried to do a small app where I could map some keybindings and then map my encoders with those same keybinds.
V0.1, will maybe update it later with some more functionalities and gui in the future when needed, or if I don't find anything else to try.
That's it. Not really fancy nor good.
